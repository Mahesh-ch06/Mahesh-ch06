- 👋 Hi, I’m Mahesh
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), particularly in optimizing search algorithms and understanding complex data structures.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DSA and focusing on dynamic programming and graph algorithms. I’m also working on a few small projects to apply what I’ve learned.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a website that provides resources and interactive tutorials for DSA, utilizing a range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies. I’m also interested in contributing to open-source DSA projects and educational content on algorithm design and implementation.
